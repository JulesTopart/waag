A simple project to train myself to the PCB designing process.

#### Why ?
Several months ago I've been working on a little autonomous car.
The car was based on a raspberry Pi coupled with an arduino.
The car was following path of the road using a neural network. I was thinking about making a simple traffic light to train the neural network to deccelerate/stop/start according to the traffic lights.

Recently, Autodesk put their well known PCB design software into Fusion 360. They've done this to facilitate the process. I'v tried Eagle before and I were really disapointed by the compexity of the process. So the new version of fusion 360 is a chance for me. 

I've decided to work on the traffic light. This is more like a test than a serious thing but I've planned to use these component : 

1. ATTiny 85
2. 5v regulator
3. 3x LEDs (Green, yellow, red)
4. 3x 100Ohm resistors
5. A precise milling machine ( like modela )
6. 9v battery
