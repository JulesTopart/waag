#### Introduction
Milling machine are a good way to produce things. They provide a subtractive methods to craft clean parts. This methods allow usage of lot of different materials like wood, plastics or even metals. Unlike 3D printed parts, milled one may be more homogeneous, more durable and more waterproof for pneumatic usages.

Milling has to be prepared. Without calculation and preparation, milling may be very time consumming. Actually, a lot of test has been made by machine and tools vendors. So we may skip testing using recomended parameters.

I've prepared a spreadsheet tool to facilitate the process of calculation. I've plan to build a Fusion 360 library with all the tools available in the lab. I've to input parameters of every tools for every material possible. So it may be a bit long. I definetly need an automatic calculation tool.

To do so I've used spreadsheet of Google. According to manufacturer informations, I've prepared a file providing all parameters of the machine.
